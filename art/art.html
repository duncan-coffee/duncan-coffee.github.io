<h1>7 Wildly Immersive Art Experiences That Will Make Your Pet Unicorn Fart Magic Dust</h1>

<h2>1) Borderless by teamLab</h2>

TeamLab Borderless is like stepping into a museum from the future, where the walls, floor, and ceiling blend seamlessly together to create an experience like no other. Visitors are immersed into a world of digital projections and surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colors and textures. No longer constrained by physical limitations, the art can move from room to room and interact with the viewer.

<h2>2) House of Eternal Return by Meow Wolf</h2>

The House of Eternal Return is unlike anything visitors have likely experienced in their daily lives. Drenched in phosphorescent neon and Day-Glo colors, visitors might be excused for having mistakenly tumbled into a fanciful alternate dimension. Following a non-linear murder mystery where fridges might just as easily function as doors, be prepared to be amazed by exploring this totally unique destination.

<h2>4) Everything in Existence by Artechouse  </h2>

Everything in Existence uses powerful imagery to evoke what it means to be living in a 21st century, hyper-connect world. Enveloping the viewer, the art takes its form from real data â€“ responding to the view, sounds in the room, or even information from social networks. This vision of art matches more closely to reality- there is not a static moment, but an ever-evolving stream.

<h2>5) Electric Desert by Klip Collective  </h2>

Electric Desert takes a different approach to relating technology and nature. Rather than a sterile museum environment, this installation is found out in the desert of Arizona. At night, visitors to the park are delighted by electrified visions of cactus and sand dunes. Be sure to bring plenty of refreshments.

The artists of Factory Obsurca, located in Oklahoma City, teamed up with Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, to guarantee a psychedelic buffet for the senses.

<h2>7) Hopscotch Light and Sound </h2>

Hopscotch Light and Sound is what might result if a EDM festival and art exhibit hit it off and had a baby. 13 distinctive installations might have visitors at one moment controlling a thunderstorm, peering into an endless hall of mirrors, or venting cathartically to a neon giant.
