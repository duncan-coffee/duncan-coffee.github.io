<p>Loud, raucous and raw, “Heartbreak Car Crash” is the sonic equivalent of a head-on collision and the first single from his upcoming debut album. The album’s songs are funny, honest, and stylistically diverse, featuring musical hooks and lyrics guaranteed to worm their way from the listener’s earholes directly to the brain and heart.
